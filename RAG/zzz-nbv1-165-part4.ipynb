    "To add a button to your UI that triggers the execution of the Python script located at `./rag-data-loader/rag_load_and_process.py`, you'll have to approach this in two main steps: updating your React frontend to include the button and setting up a backend endpoint to execute the Python script. Since React (JavaScript) runs in the browser and cannot directly execute Python scripts on the server or the client's machine, you need an intermediary - your backend server - to run the script.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Step 1: Update Your Frontend\n",
    "\n",
    "First, add a new button in your React component where you want to trigger the script execution. \n",

    "const loadAndProcessPDFs = async () => {\n",
    "  try {\n",
    "    const response = await fetch('http://localhost:8000/load-and-process-pdfs', {\n",

    "  }\n",
    "};\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Step 2: Backend Endpoint to Run the Python Script\n",
    "\n",
    "On your backend server, you'll need to add a new endpoint that, when hit by the frontend, will execute the Python script. Assuming you are using FastAPI as shown in your initial server setup, here’s how you could implement this:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "from fastapi import FastAPI\n",
    "import subprocess\n",
    "\n",
    "app = FastAPI()\n",
    "\n",
    "@app.post(\"/load-and-process-pdfs\")\n",
    "async def load_and_process_pdfs():\n",
    "    try:\n",
    "        subprocess.run([\"python\", \"./rag-data-loader/rag_load_and_process.py\"], check=True)\n",
    "        return {\"message\": \"PDFs loaded and processed successfully\"}\n",
    "    except subprocess.CalledProcessError as e:\n",
    "        return {\"error\": \"Failed to execute script\"}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Notes\n",
    "\n",
    "- This solution assumes that the server has permission to execute the Python script and access the specified directories and database.\n",
    "- The `subprocess.run` call in the FastAPI endpoint assumes Python is available in the path where the server runs, and that the script is correctly set up to be executed.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Security Considerations\n",
    "\n",
    "Running scripts or commands from a web application introduces potential security risks. Ensure proper validation and error handling around this functionality. Limit access to such endpoints to authorized users only, and consider the implications of allowing web requests to trigger server-side script execution."
