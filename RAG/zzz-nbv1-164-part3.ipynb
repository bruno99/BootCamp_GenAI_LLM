    "This code is about a box where you can type a message and a button to send that message. It's like writing a note and having a button to deliver it. Here's what each part does in simple terms:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **The Box to Write Your Message (Textarea):**\n",
    "   - You'll see \"The user will ask questions about the PDFs here.\" inside the box when it's empty, guiding you on what to do.\n",

    "     - It remembers what you're typing so it can be sent when you're ready.\n",

    "   - Clicking this button takes whatever you've written in the message box, trims any extra spaces from the beginning and end (so if you accidentally hit the spacebar too many times, it won't matter), and then does something with that message, like sending it off so others can read it.\n",

    "### Setting Up the Conversation\n",
    "- **Storing Messages**: It keeps track of all the messages sent back and forth in the conversation. Think of it as a notebook where every new message, whether from you (the user) or the AI assistant, gets written down on a new line.\n",

    "  - Sends your message to a special address (think of it like a postal address for the AI on the internet) so the AI can read it and respond.\n",
    "- **Listening for AI's Response**: After sending your message, the app waits and listens for the AI's reply, ready to add it to the notebook once it arrives.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Receiving and Showing Messages\n",
    "- **Adding AI's Messages**: When the AI sends a message back, the app decides how to add it to the notebook. If the AI sends a long reply in parts, the app knows how to put these parts together so the conversation makes sense.\n",
    "- **Displaying Source Links**: Sometimes, the AI's messages include sources or references. The app knows how to show these sources as clickable links, in case you want to learn more about what the AI is talking about.\n",

    "- **Looks and Feel**: The app has a clean and simple look, designed for easy reading and writing. It's set up a bit like a messaging app on your phone but used through a web browser.\n",
    "- **Interactive Elements**: There's a text box where you can type your questions or messages, and a \"Send\" button to click when you're ready to send your message to the AI. After you send a message, you'll see it appear in the conversation history, along with the AI's responses.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Under the Hood\n",
    "- **Handling Technical Details**: The app takes care of some technical stuff in the background, like formatting the messages so they're easy to read and ensuring the conversation flows smoothly, even if the internet connection is a bit slow or if the AI has a lot to say in response.\n",
