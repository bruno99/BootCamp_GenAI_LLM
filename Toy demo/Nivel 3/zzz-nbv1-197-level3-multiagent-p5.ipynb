    "\n",
    "1. **List Comprehension**:\n",
    "   - The code is using a Python feature called \"list comprehension\" to build a list in a compact way. List comprehensions are a concise way to create lists by iterating over an iterable and optionally including a condition to filter elements.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "3. **Creating Task for Each Technology**:\n",
    "   - `tasks.technology_research(research_agent, technology, businessareas)` is a function call. The function `technology_research`  takes three arguments:\n",
    "     - `research_agent`: the agent conducting the research.\n",
    "     - `technology`: This is the current item from the `technologies` list being processed in the loop.\n",
    "     - `businessareas`: list of business areas.\n",
    "   \n",
    "4. **List of Results**:\n",
    "   - The result of the function call for each `technology` is added to a new list. This means that for every item in the `technologies` list, the `technology_research` function is called with the current `technology`, the `research_agent`, and `businessareas` as arguments, and the result is stored in the list `technology_research_tasks`."

    "The previous Python code defines the function named `kickoff_crew` which is designed to start or \"kick off\" a specific crew, handle errors, and update a status system. Here's a breakdown of what each part does:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Function Definition**:\n",
    "   - `def kickoff_crew(input_id, technologies: list[str], businessareas: list[str]):` This function is defined to take three parameters:\n",
    "     - `input_id`: An identifier for the crew being kicked off.\n",
    "     - `technologies`: A list of technologies that the crew will work with or explore.\n",
    "     - `businessareas`: A list of business areas related to the technologies.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Print Initial Message**:\n",
    "   - `print(f\"Running crew for {input_id} with technologies {technologies} and businessareas {businessareas}\")` This line outputs a message indicating that the crew is starting its operation with specified technologies and business areas.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Crew Operation Setup and Execution**:\n",
    "   - `results = None` initializes `results` to `None`, a placeholder to store the results of the crew's operations.\n",
    "   - The `try` block contains code that might raise exceptions, which are errors during execution.\n",
    "   - `technology_research_crew = TechnologyResearchCrew(input_id)` creates an instance of the `TechnologyResearchCrew` class, initializing it with the `input_id`.\n",
    "   - `technology_research_crew.setup_crew(technologies, businessareas)` sets up the crew with the provided technologies and business areas.\n",
    "   - `results = technology_research_crew.kickoff()` attempts to start the crew's operations and store the results in the `results` variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Error Handling**:\n",
    "   - The `except Exception as e:` block catches any exceptions that occur during the crew setup or kickoff.\n",
    "   - `print(f\"CREW FAILED: {str(e)}\")` and `append_event(input_id, f\"CREW FAILED: {str(e)}\")` log the error message and append this event, indicating the failure.\n",
    "   - Inside the `with outputs_lock:` block, `outputs[input_id].status = 'ERROR'` and `outputs[input_id].result = str(e)` update a shared resource `outputs` (a dictionary) to reflect that an error occurred. The `outputs_lock` ensures that changes to `outputs` are thread-safe, meaning no other thread or process can modify `outputs` while it's being updated here.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Finalizing Crew Operation**:\n",
    "   - Another `with outputs_lock:` this block follows to update the status and results of the crew operation, ensuring thread safety.\n",
    "   - `outputs[input_id].status = 'COMPLETE'` updates the status to \"COMPLETE\".\n",
    "   - `outputs[input_id].result = results` updates the `results` of the operation.\n",
    "   - `outputs[input_id].events.append(Event(timestamp=datetime.now(), data=\"Crew complete\"))` adds a new event to the `events` list of `outputs[input_id]`, marking the completion of the crew's tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, this function initializes a crew operation with specific technologies and business areas, handles potential errors, and updates a shared status system accordingly, using thread safety mechanisms to ensure data integrity during updates."

    "Here's a breakdown of what each part does in simpler terms:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Define a Web Address and Method**:\n",
    "   - `@app.route('/api/multiagent/<input_id>', methods=['GET'])` defines a URL endpoint on the web server. This means when someone visits this URL and provides a `input_id` (like `/api/multiagent/123`), the server will execute the `get_status` function.\n",
    "   - `methods=['GET']` specifies that this URL responds to GET requests, which are typically used to retrieve data from a server.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Function to Get Output Status**:\n",
    "   - `def get_status(input_id):` defines a function that takes a `input_id` as an argument. This function will process the request and return information about the output.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Access Output Information Safely**:\n",
    "   - `with outputs_lock:` ensures that the operation of accessing output information is thread-safe. This means **if multiple people or processes try to access output data at the same time, the `outputs_lock` prevents conflicts and data corruption by allowing only one operation at a time**.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Check and Retrieve Output Data**:\n",
    "   - `output = outputs.get(input_id)` attempts to retrieve the search information using the provided `input_id`.\n",
    "   - If no output is found (`if output is None:`), the function responds with an error (`abort(404, description=\"Output not found\")`), indicating that no output was found with the given ID.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Handle Output Result Data**:\n",
    "   - The output's result, which is stored as a string, is attempted to be converted into a JSON object using `json.loads(output.result)`. JSON is a common format used to exchange data on the web.\n",
    "   - If the conversion fails due to an error in the format of the string (`except json.JSONDecodeError:`), the function falls back to using the original string format of the result.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Return the Output Information**:\n",
    "   - `return jsonify({...})` sends back a structured response in JSON format containing details about the output, such as its ID, status, result, and a list of events associated with the output.\n",
    "     - Each event in the output's list of events is formatted with a timestamp and data, making it easy to read and process.\n",
    "\n",
    "In essence, this function acts as a safe, organized way to access and retrieve detailed information about a specific output on a server, handling errors gracefully and ensuring the data is easy to use for whoever requests it."

    "1. **Import Statements**: The code starts by importing necessary Python modules and functions:\n",
    "   - `typing.List` and `typing.Type` are used for type hinting.\n",
    "   - `BaseModel` and `Field` from `pydantic` are used to create data models with validation.\n",
    "   - Standard modules `os` and `requests` are used for accessing environment variables and making HTTP requests, respectively.\n",
    "   - `BaseTool` from `crewai_tools` seems to be a base class for creating tools within an application.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Data Models**:\n",
    "   - `VideoSearchResult` is a data model to store information about each video search result, specifically the video's title and URL.\n",
    "   - `YoutubeVideoSearchToolInput` is another data model defining the inputs needed for the YouTube video search tool. It includes fields for the search `keyword` and `max_results`, the maximum number of search results to return.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **YoutubeVideoSearchTool Class**:\n",
    "   - This class extends `BaseTool` and defines a tool for searching YouTube videos. It has attributes for the tool's name, description, and the type of arguments it accepts (`args_schema`).\n",
    "   - **The `_run` method is where the actual search happens**. It uses the YouTube Data API to search for videos:\n",
    "     - **It retrieves the YouTube API key from environment variables (.env file)**. See the next section with more info about this.\n",
    "     - Constructs the API request URL and parameters.\n",
    "     - **Makes an HTTP GET request to the YouTube API**.\n",
    "     - If the response is successful, it processes the JSON data to extract video titles and URLs.\n",
    "     - Each video's information is stored in a `VideoSearchResult` instance, and all instances are collected into a list.\n",
    "     - Finally, it returns the list of search results.\n",
    "\n",
    "This tool effectively encapsulates the functionality to search for YouTube videos based on a keyword and return a specified number of results, handling everything from data validation to making the API call and processing the response."
