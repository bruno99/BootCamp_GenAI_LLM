    "The previous code defines Python classes to model and handle structured data using the `pydantic` library, which is widely used for data validation and settings management. Here's a breakdown of what each part of the code does:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Imports**:\n",
    "   - `from typing import List`: This imports the `List` type from the `typing` module, which is used to annotate types that are lists containing elements of a specific type.\n",
    "   - `from pydantic import BaseModel`: This imports `BaseModel` from the `pydantic` library, which is the base class for all models in pydantic and provides data validation among other features.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **NamedUrl Class**:\n",
    "   - This class defines a simple data model called `NamedUrl` that consists of two fields: `name` and `url`.\n",
    "   - Both fields are expected to be strings (`str`). This class can be used to represent a URL with a descriptive name attached to it, for instance, a YouTube interview with a title.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **BusinessareaInfo Class**:\n",
    "   - This class defines a model called `BusinessareaInfo` that represents information about a specific businss area.\n",
    "   - It includes several fields:\n",
    "     - `technology`: a string representing the name of the technology.\n",
    "     - `businessarea`: a string representing the name of the business area.\n",
    "     - `blog_articles_urls`: a list of strings, each being a URL to a blog article related to the business area.\n",
    "     - `youtube_videos_urls`: a list of `NamedUrl` objects, each containing a name and a URL, likely representing videos on YouTube related to the business area.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **BusinessareaInfoList Class**:\n",
    "   - This class aggregates multiple `BusinessareaInfo` instances into a list.\n",
    "   - It contains a single field called `businessareas`, which is a list of `BusinessareaInfo` instances.\n",
    "\n",
    "Essentially, these classes are designed to structure and validate information about business areas and associated resources like blogs and videos. The usage of `pydantic` allows for robust validation rules to ensure that the data conforms to the expected formats, enhancing reliability and ease of maintenance in the app that will consume this data."
