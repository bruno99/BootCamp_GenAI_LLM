    "The previous React code written in JavaScript (using JSX syntax) is designed to create a simple user interface for inputting data. Let's break down what each part of the code does:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **\"use client\";** - This directive suggests that the code is intended to run only on the client side, typically used in Next.js applications for files that should only execute in the browser and not during server-side rendering.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Imports:**\n",
    "   - `import {useState} from \"react\";` - This imports the `useState` hook from React, which is a function that lets you add React state to function components.\n",
    "   - `import InputSection from \"@/components/InputSection\";` - This imports the `InputSection` component from a directory within the project (**We will create this component next**). The `@` symbol usually represents an alias to a specific path set up in the project configuration, often pointing to the `components` folder.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Component Function:**\n",
    "   - `export default function Home() { ... }` - Defines a function component named `Home`. This component is exported as the default export of the module, meaning it can be imported without having to use its name in other parts of the application.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **useState Hooks:**\n",
    "   - `const [technologies, setTechnologies] = useState([]);` - Initializes a state variable `technologies` with an empty array. `setTechnologies` is a function used to update this state.\n",
    "   - `const [businessareas, setBusinessareas] = useState([]);` - Similarly, initializes `businessareas` state variable with an empty array and `setBusinessareas` as its updater function.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **JSX Return:**\n",
    "   - Everything inside the `return (...);` block is JSX, which is a syntax extension for JavaScript commonly used with React to describe what the UI should look like.\n",
    "   - The `<div className=\"bg-white min-h-screen text-black\">` and nested `<div>` tags define the structure and styling of the UI. The class names correspond to Tailwind CSS, a utility-first CSS framework.\n",
    "   - Inside these divs, there are instances of the `InputSection` component for both `technologies` and `businessareas`. These components are designed to handle user input for different types of data. Each component receives props like `title`, `placeholder`, `data`, and `setData`:\n",
    "     - `title` - A string that names the input section (e.g., \"Technologies\").\n",
    "     - `placeholder` - Text to display when the input field is empty, giving an example of what to enter.\n",
    "     - `data` - The current state of the input (technologies or business areas).\n",
    "     - `setData` - The function to update the state when the input changes.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Output Section:**\n",
    "   - The last `div` with the comment `{/* Output section and event log in a single column below */}` is where additional UI components will be added.\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, this `Home` component is designed to collect and manage user inputs for technologies and business areas using a clean and simple interface, with state management handled by React's `useState` hook."

    "The previous React code defines the component named `InputSection` used for adding and removing items from a list. Here’s a breakdown of what each part of the code does:\n",

    "1. `\"use client\";` - This line ensures that the component only runs in the client’s browser, not on the server. It's specifically used in frameworks like Next.js that support server-side rendering.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. `import { Dispatch, SetStateAction, useState } from \"react\";` - This line imports `useState`, a React hook used to manage state in functional components, and types `Dispatch` and `SetStateAction` for TypeScript annotations to help manage the state updates correctly.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. `type InputSectionProps = { ... };` - Defines a TypeScript type named `InputSectionProps` which specifies the expected properties (`props`) for the `InputSection` component. These include:\n",
    "   - `title`: a string that will be used as the heading of the component.\n",
    "   - `placeholder`: a string used in the input field to give users a hint about what to type.\n",
    "   - `data`: an array of strings, which holds the current list of items.\n",
    "   - `setData`: a function that updates the `data`.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. `export default function InputSection({ title, placeholder, setData, data, }: InputSectionProps) { ... }` - Defines the `InputSection` component that takes the specified props. This is a reusable component that can handle inputs for various lists like \"technologies\" or \"businessareas.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Inside the `InputSection` component:\n",
    "   - `const [inputValue, setInputValue] = useState<string>(\"\");` - Sets up a state variable `inputValue` to keep track of the current value in the input field, initially set to an empty string.\n",
    "   \n",
    "   - `const handleAddClick = () => { ... };` - Defines a function that adds the current `inputValue` to the `data` array when the \"Add\" button is clicked, provided the input is not empty (after trimming white spaces). It then clears the input field.\n",
    "\n",
    "   - `const handleRemoveItem = (index: number) => { ... };` - Defines a function that removes an item at a specific index from the `data` array. It uses the `filter` function to keep all items except the one at the given index.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. The component’s return statement describes the UI:\n",
    "   - A container `div` with a heading displaying the `title`.\n",
    "   - An input field for entering new items, with an `onChange` event to update `inputValue` as the user types.\n",
    "   - A \"Add\" button that triggers `handleAddClick` when clicked.\n",
    "   - A list (`ul`) displays all current items in `data`. Each item has a \"X\" button that, when clicked, triggers `handleRemoveItem` to remove the associated item.\n",
    "\n",
    "This setup allows users to dynamically add and remove entries in a list, with each input managed by its respective state. This component is highly reusable for different kinds of lists that require similar functionality."
