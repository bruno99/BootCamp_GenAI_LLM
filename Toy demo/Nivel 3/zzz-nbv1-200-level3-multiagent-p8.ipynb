    "This React component, named `EventLog`, is designed to display a list of event details within a web application. Here's a breakdown of what this component does in simpler terms:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Imports and Setup**: The component starts by importing React and some specific types that describe the structure of events it will display.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Props Definition**: It defines the properties (`props`) it expects from its parent component, specifically an array of events (`events`). Each event in this array is expected to follow a certain structure defined by `EventType`. `EventType` will be imported from the hook we will create in the following part.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Component Structure**:\n",
    "   - The component returns a `<div>` element styled to display its contents in a column layout, filling the height of its container.\n",
    "   - Inside this `<div>`, there's a header (`<h2>`) that labels the section as \"Event Details.\"\n",
    "   - Below the header, there is another `<div>` designed to grow to fill available space and allow scrolling if there are more events than can be displayed at once. This inner `<div>` has a border and some padding for styling.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Conditional Content Rendering**:\n",
    "   - If there are no events (`events.length === 0`), it displays a simple paragraph saying \"No events yet.\"\n",
    "   - If there are events, it iterates over the array of events using the `map` function. Each event is displayed in its own `<div>` with a border at the bottom, and it includes a paragraph that shows the event's timestamp and data.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Key Usage in Lists**:\n",
    "   - Each event `<div>` is given a unique `key` attribute, which in this case is just the index of the event in the array. This key helps React keep track of individual elements in the list, which is important for performance, especially if items in the list might change order, be added, or be removed.\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, the `EventLog` component is used to display a scrollable list of event details, with each event presented with its timestamp and relevant data. It also adapts its display based on whether any events are available to show."

    "The previous code defines a component named `FinalOutput` that displays information based on a list of technologies and business areas, including related blog articles and YouTube videos. Here's a breakdown of the main parts:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Imports and Setup**:\n",
    "    - `import React from \"react\";`: Loads the React library to use in this component.\n",
    "    - `import { BusinessareaInfo } from \"@/hooks/useCrewOutput\";`: **We will create the hook useCrewOutput in the following part**.\n",
    "    - `interface FinalOutputProps`: Defines the structure of the props that `FinalOutput` expects, specifically an array of `BusinessareaInfo`.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Component Definition**:\n",
    "    - `FinalOutput` is a functional component that receives `businessareaInfoList` as a prop, which is an array of business area information.\n",
    "    - It uses TypeScript (indicated by `: React.FC<FinalOutputProps>`) to ensure type safety, confirming that the props fit the expected structure.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Utility Function**:\n",
    "    - `capitalizeFirstLetter`: A small function defined within the component to capitalize the first letter of a given string. This function is used later to format the display text.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **JSX and Conditional Rendering**:\n",
    "    - The component returns JSX, which is a syntax used in React for describing the UI structure. The outermost `<div>` is styled to be a flexible column container.\n",
    "    - A heading (`<h2>`) describes the content below it.\n",
    "    - The main content area (`<div>` with `className=\"flex-grow overflow-auto...\"`) handles displaying the business area information. If there are no items in `businessareaInfoList`, it displays \"No output yet.\" Otherwise, it maps over the array to create UI elements for each business area.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Dynamic Content Creation**:\n",
    "    - Inside the loop (`businessareaInfoList.map(...)`), each businessareaInfoList has its technology and business area information displayed, with the text first-letter capitalized.\n",
    "    - For blog articles and YouTube videos, it checks if there are URLs available. If there are, it generates a list (`<ul>`) of clickable links (`<a>` tags). For YouTube videos, each link displays the video's name and is styled similarly.\n",
    "    - The `key` prop on each `<div>`, `<li>`, and other repeating elements is essential for React to manage the list efficiently and re-render only changed elements.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Styling and Accessibility**:\n",
    "    - The classes like `text-lg`, `font-semibold`, and others are likely from Tailwind CSS, a utility-first CSS framework.\n",
    "    - Links have attributes like `target=\"_blank\"` and `rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"` to safely open new tabs and avoid security risks.\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, the `FinalOutput` component is designed to dynamically present formatted information about technologies and business areas, along with related resources like blog posts and videos, handling both populated and empty data scenarios."
