    "Here's a breakdown of what each part of the command does in simple terms:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **`npx`**: This is a tool that comes with `npm` (Node Package Manager), which helps in executing Node packages without needing to install them globally on your system. It's used here to run the package `create-next-app` directly from the internet, ensuring you're using the latest version without having to permanently install it.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **`create-next-app@latest`**: This specifies the package to run with `npx`. `create-next-app` is a tool that sets up a starter template for a Next.js application. The `@latest` tag ensures you are using the most recent version of this tool.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **`frontend`**: This is the name of the directory where your new project will be created. After running the command, you'll have a new folder named `frontend` in your current directory, which will contain all the files of your Next.js project.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **`--typescript`**: This option tells `create-next-app` to set up the project with TypeScript support. TypeScript is a programming language that adds static types to JavaScript, helping with catching errors early during development.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **`--tailwind`**: This adds Tailwind CSS to the project. Tailwind CSS is a utility-first CSS framework that allows developers to rapidly style their applications without leaving their HTML (or JSX/TSX).\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **`--eslint`**: This option integrates ESLint into the project. ESLint is a tool for identifying and reporting on patterns found in ECMAScript/JavaScript code, making it easier to write clean and consistent code that follows best practices.\n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, this command quickly sets up a new Next.js application configured with TypeScript, **styled using Tailwind CSS**, and ready for code quality checks with ESLint, all **in the directory named `frontend`**."
