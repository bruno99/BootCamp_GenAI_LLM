    "**In React, a \"hook\" is a function that lets you \"hook into\" React state and lifecycle features from function components.** Hooks were introduced in React 16.8 as a way to use stateful logic and side effects in function components, making it possible to write entire applications with just functions instead of splitting the code between functions and classes for different features.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are a few commonly used React hooks:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **useState**: This hook allows you to add state to function components. Each call to `useState` returns a pair: the current state value and a function that lets you update it.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **useEffect**: It lets you perform side effects in function components. This might be data fetching, subscriptions, or manually changing the DOM in React components. It can replace several lifecycle methods in class components like `componentDidMount`, `componentDidUpdate`, and `componentWillUnmount`.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **useContext**: This hook allows you to subscribe to React context without introducing nesting. It lets you access the context values in function components.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **useReducer**: This is usually preferable over `useState` when you have complex state logic that involves multiple sub-values or when the next state depends on the previous one. It's also handy when managing state deep in the component tree, as it lets you pass dispatch down instead of callbacks.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **useCallback**: This hook returns a memoized callback function. This is useful when passing callbacks to optimized child components that rely on reference equality to prevent unnecessary renders.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **useMemo**: It returns a memoized value. You pass it a function that computes a value, and it will only recompute this value when one of its dependencies changes. This is helpful for expensive calculations.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. **useRef**: This hook can store a mutable value that does not cause a re-render when updated. It can be used to store a reference to a DOM element or any other data that you want to persist across renders without causing a rerender.\n",
    "\n",
    "8. **useLayoutEffect**: This works identically to `useEffect`, but it fires synchronously after all DOM mutations. Use this to read layout from the DOM and re-render synchronously.\n",
    "\n",
    "Hooks provide a more direct use to the React concepts you already know—props, state, context, refs, and lifecycle. **They offer a powerful and expressive new way to reuse functionality between components**.\n",
    "* You can learn more about React Hooks [here.](https://react.dev/reference/react/hooks)"

    "**You can build custom hooks** in React. A custom hook allows you to extract component logic into reusable functions. Custom hooks work just like regular hooks, but they enable you to create your own hooks that can use other hooks internally. This approach helps in keeping your component logic tidy, making it easier to manage, test, and reuse across your application.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here’s a general process on how to create a custom hook:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Identify Common Logic**: First, identify the common logic that is shared across multiple components. This could be anything like fetching data, subscribing to a service, handling user inputs, or any other repeated logic across your components.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Create a Function**: Define a function that starts with `use` (following the naming convention for hooks). This helps in identifying it as a hook functionally and conventionally.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Use Other Hooks**: Inside your custom hook, you can use built-in hooks like `useState`, `useEffect`, etc., to handle state and lifecycle features.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Return What’s Needed**: Your custom hook can return anything it needs to—single values, arrays, or objects. This is typically the data or functions that your components will need to use.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Here’s an example of a simple custom hook that fetches data from an API:**\n",
    "\n",
    "```javascript\n",
    "import { useState, useEffect } from 'react';\n",
    "\n",
    "function useFetchData(url) {\n",
    "  const [data, setData] = useState(null);\n",
    "  const [loading, setLoading] = useState(true);\n",
    "  const [error, setError] = useState(null);\n",
    "\n",
    "  useEffect(() => {\n",
    "    const fetchData = async () => {\n",
    "      try {\n",
    "        setLoading(true);\n",
    "        const response = await fetch(url);\n",
    "        const result = await response.json();\n",
    "        setData(result);\n",
    "        setLoading(false);\n",

    "The previous code defines a custom React hook named `useFetchData` that is designed to fetch data from a specified URL and manage the loading state and potential errors during the data fetching process. Let's break down the code to understand each part:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Imports**: The code begins by importing `useState` and `useEffect` from the React library. These are standard hooks provided by React:\n",
    "   - `useState` is used to keep track of state within a function component.\n",
    "   - `useEffect` is used to perform side effects in function components.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Function Declaration**:\n",
    "   - `useFetchData(url)` is a function that takes a `url` as its parameter. This URL is where the data will be fetched from.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **State Management**:\n",
    "   - `useState(null)` initializes the `data` state to `null`. This state will later hold the fetched data.\n",
    "   - `useState(true)` initializes the `loading` state to `true`, indicating that data fetching has started and the component should show a loading state until the data is fetched.\n",
    "   - `useState(null)` initializes the `error` state to `null`. This state will be used to store any errors that occur during the data fetching process.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Effect Hook (`useEffect`)**:\n",
    "   - `useEffect` is used here to handle the fetching of data when the `url` changes. The effect will re-run every time the `url` provided changes, which is specified by the `[url]` dependency array.\n",
    "   - Inside `useEffect`, an asynchronous function `fetchData` is defined and then called. This function handles the data fetching logic:\n",
    "     - It sets `setLoading(true)` to ensure the loading state is active while the data is being fetched.\n",
    "     - It uses the `fetch` API to make a network request to the provided `url`.\n",
    "     - If the request is successful, it processes the response as JSON and updates the `data` state with `setData(result)`.\n",
    "     - Regardless of the success of the request, it sets `setLoading(false)` to indicate that the loading process is complete.\n",
    "     - If an error occurs during the request, it is caught in the catch block, and `setError(error)` updates the error state with the caught error.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Return Values**:\n",
    "   - The hook returns an object containing the `data`, `loading`, and `error` states. This allows any component that uses this hook to easily access the fetched data, know whether the data is still loading, and handle any errors that might have occurred during the fetch.\n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, the `useFetchData` hook is a reusable utility for fetching data from a server, managing loading states, and handling errors, making it a handy tool for any component that needs to perform these operations."

    "#### Usage in a Component\n",
    "Once you have your custom hook, you can use it in your components like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "```javascript\n",
    "function App() {\n",
    "  const { data, loading, error } = useFetchData('https://api.example.com/data');\n",

These notifications, often called \"toasts,\" pop up on the screen to give users quick feedback or information. For example, after a user submits a form, you might use a toast to tell them that the submission was successful or if there was an error.\n",

    "**The hook `useCrewOutput`** that we have defined in the previous code is a custom React hook designed to manage the lifecycle and state of a job process in our application. It **integrates various functionalities, including fetching data, submitting new job requests, and polling for job status updates. Below, we will explain its main components and functionalities in simple terms:**\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Setup and Dependencies\n",
    "- **Imports**: The hook uses `axios` for HTTP requests, `useState` and `useEffect` from React for state management and side effects, respectively, and `toast` from `react-hot-toast` for displaying notifications.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### State Management\n",
    "- **useState Variables**: \n",
    "  - `running`: A boolean that indicates if a job is currently running.\n",
    "  - `technologies`, `businessareas`: Arrays that store strings representing technologies and business areas involved in the output.\n",
    "  - `events`: An array of `EventType`, storing data and timestamp information from the output process.\n",
    "  - `businessareaInfoList`: An array of `BusinessareaInfo` which includes detailed information about business areas.\n",
    "  - `currentInputId`: A string to store the ID of the currently running output.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Effects and Output Processing\n",
    "- **useEffect**: This effect is crucial for handling the polling of output status:\n",
    "  - When `currentInputId` changes, the effect sets up an interval (polling every second) to fetch the output's current status using `axios.get`.\n",
    "  - The response includes the output's status, a result containing positions data, and events.\n",
    "  - It updates the relevant state with fetched data. If the output is complete or encounters an error, it stops the interval and sets `running` to false, and notifies the user via toast messages.\n",
    "  - The cleanup function clears the interval to prevent memory leaks when the component unmounts or the input ID changes.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Functions\n",
    "- **startOutput**: A function to initiate a new output:\n",
    "  - It clears the current events and positions data and sets `running` to true.\n",
    "  - It makes a POST request with the selected technologies and business areas to start a new output and retrieves a input ID.\n",
    "  - Upon successful start, it updates `currentInputId` with the new input ID and notifies the user. If it fails, it handles errors by notifying the user and resetting the `currentInputId`.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Return Values\n",
    "- The hook returns all the state management functions and variables, including `startOutput`, allowing components that use this hook to control and access the output process statefully.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Usage\n",
    "This hook is particularly useful for components that need to manage output processes where you might be interacting with a backend service to execute tasks, monitor their status, and update the UI accordingly. It encapsulates all the logic related to output processing, making the component cleaner and focused more on rendering and less on handling complex state and effects."

    "The `Home` component in the previous code  uses the custom React hook `useCrewOutput` to manage the state and behavior of a output-related process within a user interface. **Here’s a simplified breakdown of how each part of the component interacts with the `useCrewOutput` hook and its role in the overall functionality:**\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Integration and Usage of `useCrewOutput`\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Hook Initialization**: At the beginning of the `Home` component, the `useCrewOutput` hook is called and its returned object is stored in the variable `crewOutput`. This object contains various states like `technologies`, `businessareas`, `running`, etc., as well as functions like `startOutput`, `setTechnologies`, and `setBusinessareas`.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Component Structure and Data Flow\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Layout and Styling**: The component returns a `div` with styling meant to accommodate a full-screen layout with a white background. Inside, there are two primary sections created using a flex layout, each taking half of the width of the screen.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Input Sections for Technologies and Business Areas**:\n",
    "    - Two instances of the `InputSection` component are used for inputting technologies and business areas.\n",
    "    - Each `InputSection` is passed relevant props from the `crewOutput` object:\n",
    "      - `title` and `placeholder` provide contextual labels and placeholders specific to either technologies or businessareas.\n",
    "      - `data` and `setData` are linked to either `crewOutput.technologies` or `crewOutput.businessareas`, and their respective state updating functions. This setup enables these sections to display and update the list of technologies and businessareas interactively.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Control and Output Section**:\n",
    "    - A button is provided to start the output process. It triggers the `startOutput` function from `crewOutput` when clicked. The button also shows dynamic text (\"Running...\" or \"Start\") based on the `running` state to indicate whether an output is currently active. The button is disabled when an output is running, preventing multiple output initiations.\n",
    "    - The `FinalOutput` component displays results of the output using `crewOutput.businessareaInfoList`, which contains detailed information about output businessarea once the output completes.\n",
    "    - The `EventLog` component shows logs or events from the output process, using `crewOutput.events`. This helps in monitoring real-time updates or changes during the output's execution.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Functionality and Interaction\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Dynamic Updates and Reactivity**:\n",
    "    - As users input data and start outputs, the `crewOutput` hook manages the state and updates the UI reactively. Any changes to the state in `crewOutput` (like updating technologies or businessareas, or changes in output status) will cause relevant parts of the UI to re-render appropriately.\n",
    "    - For instance, updating the list of technologies or businessareas through the `InputSection` will reflect immediately in the UI due to React's reactivity system managed via `useState`.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Effectiveness in Separation of Concerns**:\n",
    "    - The `useCrewOutput` hook abstracts the complexities of output management (like API calls, polling, and state transitions), allowing the `Home` component to focus primarily on rendering and handling user interactions smoothly.\n",
    "    - This separation ensures that the UI layer (`Home` component) is clean and more maintainable, while business logic related to output processing is encapsulated within the `useCrewOutput` hook.\n",
    "\n",
    "This setup illustrates a typical use-case in modern React development where hooks are used to manage logic and state efficiently, enabling components to remain lightweight and focused primarily on the user interface aspects."

    "The previos line of code is used to configure Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) settings for our Flask application.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Here’s a breakdown of what each part means in simpler terms:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **`CORS(...)`**: This is a function call that activates CORS handling for the Flask app. CORS is a security feature that lets you define how resources on your server can be accessed from other domains outside of your server’s domain.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **`app`**: This is the Flask application for which CORS is being enabled. It's  created earlier in our Flask code with `app = Flask(__name__)`.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **`resources={r\"/api/*\": {\"origins\": \"*\"}}`**: This part specifies which paths in your application should allow cross-origin requests, and from which origins:\n",
    "   - **`r\"/api/*\"`**: This is a pattern that matches any URL that starts with `/api/`. So, any API route like `/api/data`, `/api/info` etc., will have CORS enabled.\n",
    "   - **`{\"origins\": \"*\"}`**: This sets the allowed origins for these routes to `\"*\"`, which means any other domain can make requests to these API endpoints. It's a wildcard setting that includes all origins.\n",
    "\n",
    "In simple terms, this line is telling your Flask app to allow web pages from any other domain to request data from any of your API endpoints that start with `/api/`. This is useful when you are building web services that you intend to be accessible from different websites, mobile apps, or other online services."
